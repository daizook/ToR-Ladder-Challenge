Made with love by [Daizook](https://github.com/daizook)! :)

If you wish to use this application for your own local ladder challenge, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daizook/ToR-Ladder-Challenge.git
cd root_dir/some_path/ToR-Ladder-Challenge
streamlit run app.py

python app.py #if your streamlit command is not working
```

You are allowed to use my material and also alter the content (edit app.py as you wish). However, on your site, please put "Credit to Daizook for this application" on your Streamlit app and GitHub repository. Also, feel free to visit our ToR Discord if you're interested in competitive Pokemon: https://discord.gg/MQuHkH48. Cheers!
