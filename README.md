Made with love by [Daizook](https://github.com/daizook)! :)

This is a web application designed to automate any ladder tournament. If you wish to use this application for your own local ladder challenge, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daizook/ToR-Ladder-Challenge.git
cd root_dir/some_path/ToR-Ladder-Challenge
streamlit run app.py

python app.py #if your streamlit command is not working
```
If you wish to change the tier of your ladder tournament, go to ```app.py``` and then edit ```TIER = 'gen9uu'``` to a tier of your choice - for instance, if you want to play SV RU, change this line of code to ```gen9ru```. Please refer to Pokemon Showdown for the appropriate notation regarding the tier.

You are allowed to use my material and also alter the content (edit app.py as you wish). However, on your site, please put "Credit to Daizook for this application" on your Streamlit app and GitHub repository. Also, feel free to visit our ToR Discord if you're interested in competitive Pokemon: https://discord.gg/MQuHkH48. Cheers!
